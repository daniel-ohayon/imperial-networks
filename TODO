- [P0] Add more places with finer resolution to the ships v1 map
- [P1] explore adding the 250K people with textual analysis to the globetrotters map
- once we get the data dump from the ships, do some analysis on the owners of the ships (how many actually belonged to the Compagnie des Indes vs other stuff)

* The dynamic ship map is nice but we would need a static version for the printed book, and it should still capture the full voyage of each ship, which the ship maps V1 does not do. One possibility would be a static map with one "arrow path" per distinct voyage route, and make the size of the arrow proportional to the number of ships which have taken this route.
We'd have to figure out if this works or if there are too many distinct routes.

* There seems to be a bug in the V1 map when clicking on a location: 1) should be sorted chronologically, 2) seems like the filtering is incorrect (i.e. there are ships whose journey does not include Louisiana when you click on Louisiana)

* It would be nice to have a way to display how the volumne of ship journeys changed over time (histogram, etc)

* Bunch of stats questions on the ship journeys. Probably easiest to answer via a Python script, as they are questions about the contents of the journeys.

FEATURES
* Show trips to metropole in officials search results?
* Page scrolling should work when cursor inside map; seems to be disabled by the sigma library
* Improve UI for the animation?
    * better-looking slider?

CORE
* Move away from sigma to viz.js for the older visualizations?

RACIAL KEYWORDS
* Add click interaction
* Show all keywords for all colonies (including the 0s)
    * put Blood first
* highlight keywords in the quotes with the corresponding color
